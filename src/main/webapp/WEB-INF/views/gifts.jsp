    <h3>Hongbao</h3>
    <p>In Chinese tradition, giving monetary gifts in red envelopes is a way of wishing prosperity and 
       blessings to the newlyweds. If you would like to contribute to our life & future, we would love 
       for you to donate a small cash gift, which we will put towards a fund for our first house.</p>
    <h3>Food & Drinks</h3>
    <p>Although food & drinks will be provided over the course of the event, if you would like to
       contribute we would love for you to share with us something that you love: whether it is a box of
       your favorite snacks or a case of your favorite beer!</p>
